# This class describes the question object, which is used to represent a query by the user
# The question object contains the user's query type, the query itself, and may contain the type of language the query is in
# The question object is meant to be transformed by a transformer, like the translator class, and returned with a response
# For example, when passed to the translator, the translator will append translation response objects or a list of errors
# encountered during the translation process and return this to the caller
