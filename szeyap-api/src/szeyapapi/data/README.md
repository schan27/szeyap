# BIG data
Please read each section to understand how each file type is used and created.

## <dictionary_type>_dictionary.json
- gene_chin_dictionary.json
- stephen_li_dictionary.json

These files are the actual dictionaries databases converted into a JSON format. The json file does not need to be in a special format, but the dictionary's class must be implemented so that it converts the file into a standardized python dict structure.

See `stephenli_dictionary.py`, and notice how the `load_dictionary` fn overides the `DictionaryBase` implementation, which just loads the json file as is.

Each Dictionary Class is a singleton and is instantiated when you import the module.



## <romanization_system>_table.csv
- hsr_jyutping_table.csv
- sl_jyutping_table.csv
- gc_jyutping_table.csv
- dj_jyutping_table.csv
- jw_jyutping_table.csv


These files are taken from the sheets in `raw/Initial_Finals_Converter.xlsx`. They are read when the  singleton `class JyutpingTables` is imported. The csv file paths for each romanization table are configured in `config.json`

## tones.json
This file is taken from the spreadsheet `raw/Initial_Finals_Converter.xlsx`. Tone information is stored in cells `V1`-`AN1` in the spreadsheet, and is converted to a dict format in `tones.json`.

It is important to note that for **Gene Chin** the tone format is complicated, involving *diacritic* marks. Programatically, we use Unicode combining characters to add these marks onto the letters, see more details in the [Unicode Diacritic Marks](#unicode-diacritic-marks) section below.

In addition, Gene Chin (GC) jyutping system can have a slash indicating a rising tone at the end of the word.

All romanization sytems have their tones stored as a **key, string_value pair** such as `LOW_RISE`: `"225"`, except *GC* tones, which can **also** be stored as a tuple, as demonstrated below:
 1. `LOW_FLAT`: `["\u0302"]`
 2. `LOW_RISE`: `["\u0302", "/"]`
 3. `RARE1`: `"552"` - the same format as other romanization systems


## Unicode Diacritic Marks
In Unicode, there may be many ways to represent a letter with a special mark. This is where Unicode normalization comes in. Normalization standardizes how a special letter is represented in unicode characters, and allows us to string operations on the string.

![Chart describing the differences between the 4 Unicode decomposition formats, NFD, NFC, NFKD, NFKC](unicode_decomposition_formats.png)

For GC romanization, we store the diacritic mark in NFD form, which means the combining character (diacritic) is stored as a separate character.

When constructing a GC romanization, we add the combining ch **after** the first letter of the *final*.

#### Example - **chẽim**
Initial: **ch** \
Final: **eim** \
Tone: **LOW_FLAT** \
Construction: `ch` + `e` + `\u0343` + `im`
